# Python loops intro

## for loops
For loops runs the same code for each value in a list.

A python list looks like this:

```
[1, 5, 6, 9]
```

Be aware that the list might not be just numbers, but for simplicity we'll use numbers in this example.

### Task 1

```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

* 1.1: Make a loop that prints each number in the list
* 1.2: Make a loop that prints the number times two (2, 4, etc)
* 1.3 (bonus): Make a loop that only prints numbers that can be divided by 2

### Task 2


## while loops
