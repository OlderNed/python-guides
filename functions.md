## Functions and methods

Functions and methods, are named pieces of code. You can use functions and methods provided by the language or *libraries*, or you can write your own.

There are differences between functions and methods, but those are mostly academic in nature. In this guide you'll mostly find functions, and the only thing to keep in mind is that many people use these terms interchangeably. 

If you really want to know the difference (warning, requires more knowledge than this guide provides), you can find a good explanation [here](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-a-method-and-function-in-Python-I-have-Googled-and-found-contradicting-views-Some-seem-to-use-them-interchangeably-Can-you-give-an-example-in-code-to-clarify/answer/Jim-Dennis-1?srid=3yos).
