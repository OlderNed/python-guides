This is a collection of guides to basic concepts in Python, meant for beginners with no previous programming experience.

* [Problem solving - when do you use what technique?](problem-solving.md)
* [Loops - `for` and `while`](loops.md)
* [Strings - working with text](strings.md)
* [Numbers - doing math in code](numbers.md)

### Notes

* To make this guide more friendly to people with a math background, we consistently use "method" instead of "function".
